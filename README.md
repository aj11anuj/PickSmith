# PickSmith üîç
PickSmith is a content-based movie recommendation system that implements TF-IDF vectorisation and cosine similarity. The Python engine processes plot descriptions, genre metadata, and director information to generate personalised suggestions. It is designed as a modular application that demonstrates production-ready ML pipelines for educational and practical implementations.

## Features
- Analyses movie plot descriptions using TF-IDF vectorisation text processing  
- Combines genre, director, and rating data for hybrid and reliable recommendations  
- Measures movie cosine similarity based on processed feature vectors  
- Easy to extend with new algorithms or data sources
